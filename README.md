*"Coding in Practice"* is a fun set of topics to help middle schoolers and beginners learn the basics of coding. If youâ€™ve already checked out some of the content or plan to, youâ€™ll notice that I use a lot of helpful resources from other places. Think of it this wayâ€”this is like your first step into coding. I may not be the best coder around, but what I can do is give you a clear window to look through so you can discover the best ways to learn and grow!

Happy coding! ðŸš€

## Motivation

When we learn to code, itâ€™s not just about memorizing syntax or following textbook projects. Sure, those are important, but thereâ€™s so much more to explore! I want to help you understand *how* coding works in the real worldâ€”not just *what* to type, but *why* it matters.

Think of coding like building with LEGO blocks. First, you learn how the pieces fit together (thatâ€™s the syntax). But then, you start imagining cool creations (thatâ€™s problem-solving!). With a strong foundation, you can:

- **Explore advanced topics** (like game design or robotics) more easily.
- **Stay curious and excited** about coding (no boring drills!).
- **Bring your ideas to life** smoothly (because youâ€™ll *get* how things work).

Ready to dive deeper? Letâ€™s make coding fun, meaningful, and full of "Aha!" moments! ðŸ’¡

## Material

The material is open to all. How to use the materials.

**ROI** section tells what you need to invest, it is about your time and money. You may need to spend 60 minutes to go through the lecture and another 60 minutes to do the exercises. And sometimes you find one tool we recommended is super useful, but it is not always free, you may need to purchase the tool if you really want it. We also define the returns, we hope you can develop a small tool or project by yourself. And you also have a chance to show case your tool or project.

**Text** is just the main paragraph of each topic, you at least will find several examples which are related to the topic. And the step by step coding guide.

**Slides** is for class, it is a summary or short version of the whole text.
