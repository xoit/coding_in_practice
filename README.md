*"Coding in Practice"* is a fun set of topics to help middle schoolers and beginners learn the basics of coding. If youâ€™ve already checked out some of the content or plan to, youâ€™ll notice that I use a lot of helpful resources from other places. Think of it this wayâ€”this is like your first step into coding. I may not be the best coder around, but what I can do is give you a clear window to look through so you can discover the best ways to learn and grow!

Happy coding! ðŸš€

## Motivation

When we learn to code, itâ€™s not just about memorizing syntax or following textbook projects. Sure, those are important, but thereâ€™s so much more to explore! I want to help you understand *how* coding works in the real worldâ€”not just *what* to type, but *why* it matters.

Think of coding like building with LEGO blocks. First, you learn how the pieces fit together (thatâ€™s the syntax). But then, you start imagining cool creations (thatâ€™s problem-solving!). With a strong foundation, you can:

- **Explore advanced topics** (like game design or robotics) more easily.
- **Stay curious and excited** about coding (no boring drills!).
- **Bring your ideas to life** smoothly (because youâ€™ll *get* how things work).
